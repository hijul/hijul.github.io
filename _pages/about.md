I am a 5th year Neuroscience PhD student in the lab of [Andreas Luethi](https://www.fmi.ch/research-groups/groupleader.html?group=35), interested in how the brain integrates sensory stimuli to compute their Valence and Salience. In my work I concentrate on understanding the role of the amygdala in this process and use Miniscope Imaging, Two-Photon Imaging and Optogenetics to dissect it's contribution to these processes.

During my Masters I contributed to a number of papers, while working with [Aristides Arrenberg](https://arrenberg-lab.de/) at the University of Tuebingen. We tried to understand the precise dependence of the optokinetic response (OKR) on stimulus location [(1)](https://elifesciences.org/articles/63355v1), the tuning of neurons in pretectum and tectum to different Motion directions [(2)](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-019-0648-2), the receptive field structure of tectal and pretectal neurons [(3)](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/pdf/S2211-1247(19)31681-X.pdf) and the impact of optical artifacts on visual neuroscience with small aquatic animals [(4)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-81904-2).
